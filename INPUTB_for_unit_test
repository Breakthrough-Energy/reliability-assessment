DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES IN CARD ZZMC
-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------
 VARIABLES FOR CONVERGENCE TEST:
  KWHERE : 1 = AREA (TO BE SPECIFIED)
           2 = POOL

  WVWHEN : 1 = HOURLY STATISTICS
           2 = PEAK STATISTICS

  KVSTAT : 1 = LOLE
           2 = EUE (USED ONLY WITH HOURLY STATS)

  KVTYPE : 1 = WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF STATS, CONSIDERING FORECAST ERROR)
           2 = USE ONLY THE NO FORECAST ERROR STATISTIC

   KVLOC : AREA NUMBER (USED ONLY IF KWHERE = 1)

  CVTEST : 0 = STOP WHEN STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE TESTED STATISTIC
               IS LESS THAN (.025*MEAN),I.E.,WHEN WE ARE 95% CONFIDENT
               THE ESTIMATE IS WITHIN 5% OF TRUE VALUE.
          >0 = STOP WHEN STANDARD DEVIATION IS LESS THAN CVTEST.

  FIN    : TIME TO END SIMULATION IF NO CONVERGENCE. IT SHOULD BE
           MULTIPLE OF 8760.

 OTHER VARIABLES:
  STEP : 1 = COLLECT STATS EVERY HOUR.
         24 = DAILY PEAK STATS ONLY.

  FREQ : 1 = USE HOURLY MONTE CARLO DRAWS OF GENERATOR AND LINE STATUS.
         24 = USE DAILY MONTE CARLO DRAWS.

  MAXE : DEFINES THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE PROB DISTRIBUTION OF EUE.

  II   : 0 = DO NOT PRINT TRANSMISSION MOD RESULTS.
         1 = PRINT TRANSMISSION MOD RESULTS.

  IJ   : 0 = DO NOT PRINT AFTER EACH REPLICATION

  IR   : 0 =DELETE DUMP AFTER THE RUN 
         1 = RETAIN DUMP AFTER THE RUN

  IN   : INTERNAL, IN NUMBER OF REPLICATIONS, FOR STORING
         THE CONTENTS OF ARRAYS FOR RESTART.
         1 = PRINT AFTER EACH REPLICATION

  D    : 0 = DO NOT PRINT INPUT DATA
         1 = PRINT INPUT DATA

  M    : 0 = DO NOT PRINT PLANNED OUTAGE SCHEDULES
         1 = PRINT PLANNED OUTAGE SCHEDULES
