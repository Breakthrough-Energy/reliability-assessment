    Note: neither rng.choice nor vectorization trick is appropriate here due to 
          the following reasons:
          1) The capacity probability of each gen unit CAN BE different with each otherâ€™s. 
             That is why the PROBG array is originally designed as 2-D but not 1-D.
          2) The rng.choice function cannot (or can but awkwardly) adapt to the situation here due to 1); 
          3) Most of all: generating a random vector and applying vectorized operation may 
             break a critical implicit requirement for the Monte Carlo simulation -- 
             "generated random numbers should be mutually independent."
