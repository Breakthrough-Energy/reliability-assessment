Capabilities and Data
---------------------
The reliability assessment program reads in and interprets generation properties,
ownership, firm contracts, transmission link data between areas, and other important
power system data with simulation settings on an area basis. Then the program calculates
key reliability indices according to industry standards, including LOLE (Loss of Load
Expectations), Hourly LOLE (HLOLE in short), and EUE (Expected Unserved Energy, in kWh or
MWh) for electric systems. Those reliability indices measure the availability of
generation and transmission capacity given a preset table of failure probabilities. It
also creates a planned generation unit maintenance library and the probabilistic
distribution of each defined outage for the users to assess the system reliability risk.
