                        MGN means this is the annual sum of negative margins, EUE
                        SOL means this is the cumulative sum, all years, LOLE
                        SNG means this is the cumulative sum, all years, EUE

                    The fourth digit identifies the cause of the outage
                        T is transmission
                        G is generation
                        S is the sum of t & g

                     The fifth digit indicates whether the stat is hourly or peak
                         H is for hourly stats
                         P is for peak stats
