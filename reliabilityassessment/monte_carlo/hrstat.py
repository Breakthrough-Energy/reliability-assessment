                    The first three digits identify the type of statistic
                        LOL means this is annual loss of load statistic of some type
                        MGN means this is annual sum of negative margins (EUE)
                        SOL means this is the cumulative sum, all years, LOLE
                        SNG means this is the cumulative sum, all years, EUE

                    The fourth digit identifies the cause of an outage
                        T is transmission
                        G is generation
                        S is sum of t & g

                     The fifth digit indicates whether the stat is hourly or peak
                        H is for hourly stats
                        P is for peak stats
